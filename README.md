Use Better Comment Externsion at VSCode for better display, because i make all material in one file(app.py)
If you want use app.py:
1. comment all code, because there are 540 line code , if you not comment all code first and run, the output gone be long :)
2. uncomment code what you want to see
3. Run Your code
