# Hello 👋
This is all basic python i learned

Use Better Comment Externsion for better display, because i make all material in one file(app.py file)
If you want use app.py:
1. comment all code, because there are 540 line code , if you not comment all code first and run, the output gone be long :)
2. uncomment code what you want to see
3. Run Your code

I Learn at Programming With Mosh-Full Course Python, but i little bit change the code  when i learn and watch the video
